## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Add New Regional Profiles

Help us expand to more regions!

```python
# Add to core/infrastructure_profile.py
REGIONAL_PROFILES = {
    # ... existing profiles ...
    "Japan": {
        "loop_speed": 0.20,      # Fast supply chains
        "automation": 0.95,      # Highest robot density globally
        "error_tolerance": 0.06, # Very strict quality
        "description": "Advanced manufacturing, high precision"
    },
    "Mexico": {
        "loop_speed": 0.35,      # Nearshoring benefits
        "automation": 0.60,      # Growing automation
        "error_tolerance": 0.12,
        "description": "Nearshore to USA, growing tech"
    }
}
```

**Guidelines:**
- Base on real data (robot density, logistics performance index)
- Add source references in description
- Test profile with `python core/infrastructure_profile.py`

### 2. Run Extended Experiments

**Environments we need:**
- ‚úÖ CartPole (done)
- ‚è≥ Acrobot (partial)
- ‚è≥ LunarLander (planned)
- üìÖ Atari Pong
- üìÖ MuJoCo HalfCheetah

**Process:**
1. Run training: `python training/train_regional_infrastructure.py --env [ENV_NAME]`
2. Share results: Create issue with CSV logs
3. We'll integrate into benchmark table

### 3. API Integrations (Phase 8.3)

Help integrate live data sources!

**Priority APIs:**
- [ ] Freightos (shipping delays)
- [ ] OECD Manufacturing API
- [ ] World Bank Logistics Performance Index
- [ ] IEA Energy Prices
- [ ] Trading Economics

**Template:**
```python
# core/data_sources/[source]_api.py
class [Source]DataSource:
    def __init__(self, api_key):
        self.api_key = api_key
    
    def fetch_data(self, region):
        # API call implementation
        pass
    
    def to_infrastructure_params(self, data):
        # Map to loop_speed, automation, error_tolerance
        pass
```

### 4. Improve Visualizations

**Ideas:**
- Interactive Plotly dashboards
- Real-time monitoring web interface
- 3D infrastructure parameter space visualization
- Animated learning curves

### 5. Statistical Analysis

**Contributions needed:**
- ANOVA implementation
- Causal inference (structural equation models)
- Bayesian analysis
- Meta-analysis across experiments

### 6. Documentation

**Help improve:**
- Tutorial notebooks
- Video explanations
- Translated documentation (German, Chinese, etc.)
- Use-case examples

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/[username]/emotion-augmented-nn.git
cd emotion-augmented-nn/src/DQN

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests (when implemented)
pytest tests/
```

## Code Style

- **Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Style:** PEP 8
- **Docstrings:** Google style
- **Type hints:** Preferred but not required
- **Comments:** English only

**Example:**
```python
def modulate_reward(
    self,
    reward: float,
    step: int,
    flush: bool = False
) -> float:
    """
    Modulate reward based on infrastructure feedback speed.
    
    Args:
        reward: Original reward from environment
        step: Current step number
        flush: If True, return all buffered rewards
        
    Returns:
        Delayed/modulated reward value
    """
    # Implementation
```
